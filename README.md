# 2048 Game Deployment with Docker and AWS

This project automates the deployment of the 2048 game, a popular single-player sliding block puzzle game, using Docker for containerization and Amazon Web Services (AWS) for cloud hosting.

## Project Components

- **Docker**: Creates a containerized version of the 2048 game for consistent deployment across any environment.
- **GitHub**: Serves as the version control system to host and manage the game's source code.
- **Amazon Elastic Beanstalk**: Streamlines the deployment process and application scaling.
- **AWS CloudFormation**: Manages and provisions the AWS resources in a repeatable way using templates.
